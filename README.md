# 🏛️ Computer Architecture Lab

Welcome to the **Computer Architecture Lab** repository! 🎉 This repository contains various experiments and assignments related to digital design and computer architecture, primarily using **ISE Xilinx**.

---

## 📌 About the Lab
🖥️ This lab focuses on designing, simulating, and implementing fundamental computer architecture concepts using **Verilog/VHDL** in **ISE Xilinx**. The experiments range from simple logic gates to more complex processors.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Requirements
✅ **ISE Xilinx** (Recommended version: 14.x)  
✅ **Verilog/VHDL** for hardware design  
✅ A computer with Windows/Linux for running Xilinx
